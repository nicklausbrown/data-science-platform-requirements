# Data Science Platform Functional Requirements

## Introduction
Welcome! This is not data science software or a framework. Neither is it an attempt to build a platform. This is a living document to help consolidate best practices and communicate the data science community's workflows and needs to software and platform developers. It is not meant to be industry specific nor is it meant to be about a particular niche of AI/ML. It is meant to support the broader scientific and engineering goals to which we all aspire. Let's go faster and farther, together.

## Contribution
Thank you for considering contributing to this project! It's people like you that inspire all of us to be better data professionals. This project can use every perspective, and we look forward to you  engaging with all of us in improving the data science ecosystem.

This living document should be updated and the structure evolved. There should likely be platform requirements for specific sectors like financial services, healthcare, etc. Requirements should continued to be linked through hyperlinks and workflows added in addition to the requirements. Diagrams are welcome for additional clarity.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. It likely makes sense to adopt a way of tagging issues and pull requests like NEW SECTION, NEW STAKEHOLDER, UPDATE IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL, ADD IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL, CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. I would be interested in anyone's thoughts on how to proceed with issues and pull requests for this document - especially if this is already a well solved problem.
